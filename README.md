# 3D-Marketplace
A small market place to upload, download, sell, buy and view 3D models, made using the MERN (Mongo, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS) stack.<br>
**Inspiration:** Giphy and Sketchfab.
The project will be made in 2 iterations: 
## First iteration:
  Image market place, the website will contain all the basics features to see, upload, edit, comment, search and interact with uploaded images (Gifs?) using authentication, it'll be open also to un-authenticated users. 
## Second iteration:
  Focused on the 3D viewer (maybe using Three.js) and the edit page to manipulate some properties of the 3D model.
